# Two-Factor-Authentication
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different forms of identification to access a system or application.

Traditionally, authentication involves only a username and password. However, 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide an additional form of identification, which could be a one-time password (OTP).
